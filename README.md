# AUTOMATED-REPORT-GENERATION - Codtech Internship Task 2
This project is part of Task 1 for the CodTech Python Internship. This project demonstrates how to create an automated PDF report using Python and the FPDF library. The goal of the task is to read structured data from a CSV file, analyze it, and generate a well-formatted and professional-looking PDF report without manual effort. For this task, we chose a real-world use case — a Library Book Lending Report that summarizes borrowing activity in a fictional programming library.

## Project Overview
Task 2 focuses on building an automated system in Python to read structured data from a CSV file and generate a clean, professional PDF report. For this task, a fictional **Library Book Lending Report system** was created using a dataset of programming-themed books. The Python script uses pandas to analyze book borrowing records—such as borrower's name, date borrowed, date returned, and current status—and then uses the fpdf library to produce a formatted, printable report. The final PDF includes a title, timestamp, lending data table, summary statistics, and a closing note—all automatically generated without manual intervention.

This project showcases real-world applications of automation, such as managing lending systems in libraries. The report layout includes styled headers, pastel coloring, aligned content, and statistical summaries for readability and professionalism. All data used is **fictional**. This task has been an excellent opportunity to learn about integrating data analysis and document generation, and I sincerely thank CodTech IT Solutions for this enriching experience.

## Dataset: Library Book Lending
The CSV file used in this project simulates lending activity in a programming-themed library. It contains fictional records of book lending, including book IDs, book titles (fictional programming books), borrower names, dates of borrowing and returning, and current lending status.

**CSV Columns:**
- **Book ID**: Unique identifier for each book.
- **Title**: Title of the programming-themed book.
- **Borrower**: Name of the person who borrowed the book.
- **Date Borrowed**: The date when the book was borrowed.
- **Date Returned**: The date when the book was returned (if returned).
- **Status**: Current status of the book (Returned or Borrowed).
This structured format allows to create informative tables and summaries in the report.

## Tools & Libraries Used:
- **Python**: Programming language used to implement the script.
- **Pandas**: For reading and processing CSV data.
- **FPDF**: A lightweight Python library to generate PDF documents.
- **datetime**: To include dynamic timestamps in the report.

## About the Auto-Generated PDF Report
This project automatically generates a clean, professional, and informative PDF report from a CSV file. The resulting file is called:
It is created using the Python fpdf library and includes neatly formatted tables, summaries, and report metadata without any manual effort. The report is suitable for academic, library, or internal documentation purposes.

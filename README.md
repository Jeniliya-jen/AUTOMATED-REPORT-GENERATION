# AUTOMATED-REPORT-GENERATION - Codtech Internship Task 2
This project demonstrates how to create an automated PDF report using Python and the FPDF library. The goal of the task is to read structured data from a CSV file, analyze it, and generate a well-formatted and professional-looking PDF report without manual effort. For this task, we chose a real-world use case â€” a Library Book Lending Report that summarizes borrowing activity in a fictional programming library.
